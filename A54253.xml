            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A bright ſhining Light, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THere is nothing to be known of Chriſt in the Spirit, and in the Myſtery, by all the higheſt Forms in the whole World; For we ſee many live in them, yet never come to enjoy Chriſt in the Spirit; and all is, becauſe they make theſe Forms, Duties, and Fellowſhips to be no other but Graven Images, wherein they reſt, and bleſs themſelves in their Idols, and ſay (in their hearts) Theſe be thy Gods, O <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But be aſſured, for all theſe thy Graven Images which thou haſt ſo bedecked, and that are ſo ſacred that no Man may ſpeak againſt them, but he ſhall be cenſured for a Devil, a Blaſphemer, a Son of <hi>Belial;</hi> yet the Lord, when He comes with <hi>His Light,</hi> He will diſcover thy Nakedneſs, thy Witchcrafts, thy Sorceries; and He will let thee ſee thou art no Saint, as thou wouldſt be thought to be, but a Devil transformed into an Angel of Light.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But as ſure as the Lord lives, before whom I ſtand, this is not the Way: but the Way is, for Man to be ſtript, made naked, that he may be cloathed upon. His ſtrength is to ſit ſtill, to deny himſelf, and his own Life too, or elſe he cannot be Chriſt's Diſciple.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nay, though thou art in the very Chariot of Religion, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt profeſſion of the Truth, and haſt choſen to thy ſelf the pureſt Form, and Church-Fellowſhip, or any thing elſe which can be named; In <hi>that Day</hi> when the Lord will ariſe, they ſhall be all cut off, all utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, like <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his Chariots in the Sea. Let it be what it will wherein thou truſteſt, all theſe ſhall be cut off from thine hand. Tho M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n may admire them, and eſteem them the higheſt, the wiſeſt, the graveſt, the ſtricteſt of all the Sons of Men, yet the LORD ſees them to be the worſt, the wickedeſt, the pureſt Hypocrites of all others.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All that Witchcraft which Men have uſed in the Things of God, in ſetting up Images, Forms and Shadows, and herein deluded Men, making them believe they were the <hi>Things</hi> themſelves; and though they have wrought them up never ſo curiouſly, and made them as near the life as might be, yet in <hi>that Day</hi> they ſhall come to ſee they were but Images, and dead things, which could not help at all, though they were made after the beſt pattern, and never ſo like the Things of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We may ſafely conclude, that All Men without diſtinction, until Chriſt be revealed in them, are joyned in one way of Idolatry and ſalſe Worſhip; And though they may cenſure and condemn each other, yet
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98731:3"/>to God they are all Idolaters, Inchanters, and are mad after Idols.</p>
            <p>They are ſtill carried out very zealouſly to outward Obſervations, and carnal things; and if any ſhall in the leaſt touch them in them, they are preſently offended, raging and mad; for ye touch their <hi>Abſalom,</hi> their very Lives. Theſe Phariſees are always very much offended with the neglect of ſmall matters, and of things indifferent, which either the doing, or leaving undone, is no ſign of <hi>Sincerity</hi> or <hi>Inſincerity:</hi> but they can neglect the weighty matters of the Law themſelves, and ſuffer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to do ſo, and never be offended. They are more ſtrict in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Traditions of their Church, and of Men, than of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, and the weighty matters of the Law. They are conſtant in obſerving outward Forms of Worſhip, and Times of Prayer, and the like; but never mind what is in their hearts, as evil Thoughts, Adulteries, Lies, Malice, Envy, Covetouſneſs, Pride, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe things they neglect and paſs by as ſmall matters. They can hate the Truth, and bely the Truth, and perſecute the Profeſſors and Poſſeſſors thereof, but they cannot endure any ſhould ſpeak a word againſt their formal and outward Worſhip. They indeed are very ſtrict and careful to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all their outward Ceremonies and Worſhips, and they glory in theſe things; but for all this they are no other but Diſſemblers and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, being only gilded over with a form of Piety and Religion; but within they are rotten and ſtinking Sepulchres, which are full of ſtench and dead mens bones.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And in the Day of the LORD they ſhall be aſhamed of their Confidences, and of their Idols wherein they truſted, and which they have ſo decked up, to make the World believe they are the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers; when-as they have done nothing elſe but ſet up their own Inventions, and the works of their own hands; all ſavouring of Fleſh, and of Man, and humane things, and nothing at all of Chriſt really, but meerly in Words, in Names, and in Notions.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Theſe Phariſees are furniſhed at all times, they can preach and pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are fitted at all times, they can at an hour command themſelves; they can pray either in the Chamber, in the Temple, or in the Cloſet, and keep their ſet-rules and hours; and this is their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. And all that do not follow their Modes and Forms, they account looſe and prophane. And they can judge and cenſure a Brother for a Mote in his Eye, but perceive not the Beam in their own Eye. Theſe are the Men our LORD ſo much aimed at, and had ſo much ado to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe and convince: and Him they ſo much hated, becauſe He had ſuch a ſlight opinion of them, and of their Holineſs; and becauſe He cenſur'd them for Hypocrites, and blind Phariſees, nay the worſt of all Men,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98731:3"/>yea worſe than Whoremongers, Thieves, and Murderers.</p>
            <p n="8">8. But the other, who worſhip God in the Spirit, and have their help and dependence on the LORD only, they ſee really their own Inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, and they receive all by waiting on GOD only, they cannot ſpeak, nor preach, nor pray, but when He doth all theſe in them. They will not be unjuſt to Men, becauſe they have an inward principle that conforms them to the mind of Chriſt. In brief, the one keep a great deal of ſtir, and are very buſy and exact about Outſides, Forms, Times, Places, and the like; when as the other ſee the vanity and folly of ſuch things. For if any carnal or external thing be ſet up in the room of Chriſt, this is no leſs than Witchcraft, Sorcery, and Deluſion.</p>
            <p n="9">9. We will name one more of their Sorceries and Inchantments, and 'tis a very great one, in that they take upon them (whatever they ſay to the contrary) the very office and place of Chriſt, calling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Teachers, ſaying, <hi>Come to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, and hearken to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, and We will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you and teach you what Means and what Rules you ſhould uſe; Come, joyn your ſelves in fellowſhip with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, and conform to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, and walk with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, for We will ſhew you the beſt Way. We have over-lookt and examin'd all other Church-fellowſhips, and none like Ours; We are according to the Primitive Pattern, and to the Mind of Chriſt.</hi> And they ſay moreover, <hi>We have the Word of the LORD with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, We have a Revelation, and We have ſeen a Viſion.</hi> When indeed they have ſeen nothing, but boaſt of things without their meaſure, and ſpeak not the things they have ſeen and heard: yet will ſay, <hi>The LORD hath ſpoken;</hi> and, <hi>This is the Word of the LORD.</hi> Herein the Prophet is not only deluded, but the People alſo: for they have joyned themſelves with theſe Prophets, and there they will ſtick, and their Faith is pinn'd upon their Sleeves; and ſo this Prophet (as thou takeſt him to be) becomes thy Pope. And this is the great Enchantment and Miſchief in our times.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And when they have got into this Chariot of Religion, and theſe Forms of Worſhip, then they think themſelves ſafe. How many thouſands of People are got into theſe ways, and joyned themſelves to theſe rich Citizens, and never yet were emptied, made miſerable, and nothing; never loſt their own Lives, never (fully) took up the Croſs of Chriſt, nor forſook themſelves? but having taken up a Form ſuitable to their liking, ſay, Now I am ſafe, now I am well; whatever others do, I am in a good condition; I am wiſer than others, I am holier than they; ſtand further off, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. Theſe Men are become Maſters of their Religion, 'tis true, for Religion was never yet Maſter over them.</p>
            <p n="12">12. But when the LORD ſhall ariſe with <hi>His Light,</hi> then all theſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98731:4"/>Inchantments, and all the Inchanters will be confounded. You ſhall no more be deceived with fine, ſmooth, ſoft words, <hi>There ſhall be no more a Magician, nor a Southſayer, nor any that worketh a Divination; for He will deliver His People out of their hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. Nay, Tho they be old received Idols, and of long ſtanding, and made by the moſt exact and curious Workmen, and ſcarce ever queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, but receiv'd as if made by GOD Himſelf, yet even <hi>theſe things</hi> ſhall be diſcovered and detected, and the Idols and Idol-makers ſhall be confounded together.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Were Men come to the <hi>True Light,</hi> and were able to ſtand in it, and walk in it, they would not go forth as they do in their own Name, in their own Wiſdom and Power, &amp;c. How many Speakers be there now, and with what confidence do they come unto you? when the Spirit from on high never came upon them; they never yet waited at Wiſdoms Gate; never yet ſtaid at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for the Promiſe of the Father. O that theſe Men did but know from whence they ſpeak! O that they did but know whether they were ſent from <hi>Chriſt</hi> or <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt!</hi> who indeed ſit in the Temple of Chriſt, as if ſent from Chriſt; Nay, let me tell you, they come with ſuch deceivableneſs of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, with ſuch ſigns and lying wonders, that they are able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, if it were poſſible, the very <hi>Elect</hi> of God. But the truth is, 'tis only <hi>They</hi> that can diſcover them, 'tis only the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt that can lay them open; only He that hath the <hi>True Light,</hi> can diſcover theſe hidden deeds of darkneſs.</p>
            <p n="15">15. They that have the <hi>True Light,</hi> and the <hi>True Spirit,</hi> dare not go forth to ſpeak of the Things of God, but in trembling and fear. They know they muſt have the Inward Teaching before they can open their Mouths; the Coal from the Altar to touch their Lips, or elſe they dare not ſpeak. They know the Spirit of their Father is an Almighty, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Free Spirit, (like the Wind that bloweth whither it liſteth, Man neither knoweth whence it cometh, nor when:) Sometime the Cloud is removed, when He pleaſeth; and then they may, yea, muſt go forth, then they may journey: but when the day is cloudy and dark, and the Spirit of the Lord doth not ſpeak in them, then they muſt be content to ſit ſtill, till the Day that the LORD Himſelf takes up the Cloud. Man can never remove it, no not one hour or minute ſooner, but when the Spirit liſteth: But in the Day of <hi>Light</hi> then they may go forward; nay, then they ſhall go forth with Power; Then they ſhall not ſpeak as the Scribes and Phariſees, but with Authority: Then they ſhall not regard the praiſe of Men, nor glory in thoſe things that the fooliſh and vain heart of Man doth.</p>
            <p n="16">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:98731:4"/>
16. O let no Woman be heard in the Church, but only the Voice of Chriſt: Let Him encreaſe, but let Man, and all the Womanly Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Man decreaſe, and whatever is of Man: Whenever he would have Glory, or be any thing, let him be confounded, and the Pit ſhut her mouth upon him; for it's not only unſeemly, but a ſhame for the Woman to ſpeak in the Church.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Happy is that Soul who hath forſaken Himſelf, and all other Lights, and minds only this <hi>True Light</hi> from the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> that cannot follow any other Counſel, that knows the <hi>Voice</hi> of Chriſt, and the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of Chriſt from all other Lights or Lives; and that will not follow the Voice of any Stranger. They know the <hi>Light,</hi> and Shinings forth of God, from all other Shinings. Theſe are the true Wiſe-Men, the ſpiritual and true Magicians; if they ſee any other Star, they can diſtinguiſh it, and follow His Star alone.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Nay, further; Satan hath his Policy and Inchantment, he can cry down an Inchantment in one Form, that he may be more ſecure in another, and yet be Satan ſtill. What a ſtir does all the World make about ſetting up of ſeveral Inventions and Forms? And every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Fellowſhip ſay, <hi>We are in the right Way, our Way is the beſt, and we are neareſt the Rule and Primitive Practice, and our Way is the Way of Peace and Reſt. Such and ſuch they miſs the Rule in this and that; but our Way is the moſt exact, and moſt perfect of all.</hi> All which is no other but that which Chriſt foretells ſhall come, when they ſay, <hi>Lo, here is Chriſt, or, Lo, he is there:</hi> but Chriſt's Command is, <hi>Go not after them; for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God comes not with obſervation, nor conſiſts in outward obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor in Meats or Drinks, nor in obeying the Commands or Rules of Men:</hi> for all things of that nature are far below theſe Spiritual things, in which <hi>conſiſts the Kingdom of God, which is Righteouſneſs, Joy, Peace in the Holy Ghoſt, and in being baptized with the Spirit, and with Fire.</hi>

Chriſt ſays, Go not after Them, joyn not with them, for they lead thee from thy Beloved; and thoſe thou runneſt after, and thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy Friends, will be found Liers, Deceivers, and Blaſphemers. If they ſay, <hi>Lo, He is in this Form, or that Mode only, in this Rule, or that Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; here thou ſhalt find Reſt and Satisfaction; here is He whom thou ſeekeſt, here is thy Beloved:</hi> Know all things of this nature are but Lies and Deluſions.</p>

21. My Friends, You that talk ſo much of Chriſt, and are very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for Him outwardly (as one would think) none more, and keep ſuch a ſtir about your <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Orders;</hi> except you have found <hi>Chriſt in you,</hi> in vain do you pretend to Him: for you but draw nigh to Him with your Lips, when your Hearts are removed far from Him.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Nay, I dare be bold to ſay, if Chriſt ſhould but come to you (or ſend any) to convince you of your Bondage and Deliverance, You would hate Him, ſpit at Him, crucifie Him with as much Malignity as ever the <hi>Jews</hi> did: for in truth, the whole World, in all their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Forms, love not Chriſt, nor aim at Him, nor worſhip Him; but love and ſeek themſelves. And certainly this is <hi>that Light</hi> which ſhall break forth in theſe latter days of the World, to ſtrip, unmask, and diſcover all the Religion of <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="23">23. <hi>What do you mean to ſpeak ſo harſhly againſt the Church of Chriſt, and People of God?</hi> I anſwer: Far be ſuch a thought from my heart, I would not do it for a World. But this I ſay, If they were the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, then they would not keep ſuch a ſtir about an outward Gathering, and an external Memberſhip, but they would own the Church of Chriſt, which is ſpiritual and myſtical, for <hi>ſuch</hi> is the Body of Chriſt; it is univerſal, and not lockt up in this Way, or that Form: but here they pitch their Love, and all others they behold afar off, who are not ſquared to their Church-way. But in vain do they tell me of their Saintſhip, or of being the People of God; for while they reſt in Shadows, Forms, or any outward thing, Chriſt in the Spirit, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, cannot come: Therefore 'tis expedient for You that He go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as to all theſe things, elſe <hi>He</hi> cannot ſend the Comforter, which leads into all Truth.</p>
